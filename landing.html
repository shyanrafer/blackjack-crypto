        <h2>Welcome to â‚¿lackjack Crypto!</h2>
        <br>
        <p>Thank you for stopping by to play a couple hands. Here are some rules:</p>
        <br> 
        <ul>
          <li>Blackjack pits player vs. dealer using one or more decks</li>
          <li>Card values: Numbered as given value, face cards as 10, ace as 1 or 11</li>
          <li>Objective: Beat the dealer by getting Blackjack (21), having a higher card count than the dealer without exceeding 21, or the dealer busting</li>
          <li>Player places a bet before the hand by clicking 'bet'; bet is set when 'deal' is clicked.</li>  
          <li>Both player and dealer receive two cards; player decides to "hit", "stay", or "double"</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <p>No actual bets are placed when playing this game. There is both no potential for monetary risk or gain.</p>
